  ## Architecture ðŸ—¼
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

  
  ## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
 - [NY times API] - API for fetching most popular data within 7 days.
 - [Kotlin delegate]- The Delegation pattern has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance, and Kotlin supports it natively requiring zero boilerplate code.
 - [Data binding] -The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
 - [Dagger 2] -agger 2 is dependency injection framework. It is based on the Java Specification Request (JSR) 330. It uses code generation and is based on annotations.
